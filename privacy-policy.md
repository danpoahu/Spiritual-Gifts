# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** September 23, 2025

This app (“the App”) helps you complete personal assessments and view your results.
We designed it to be private by default.

## What we collect
- **No account, no tracking, no ads.**
- Your answers and results are stored **locally on your device** using system storage (UserDefaults).
- We do **not** collect, transmit, or sell personal data to any server or third party.

## Exports and sharing
If you choose to export a PDF or share your results, the file is generated on-device.
Sharing uses the iOS system share sheet; you control where it goes.

## Data retention and deletion
- Data remains on your device until you delete the app or clear it manually.
- Deleting the app removes the locally stored data.

## Children’s privacy
This app is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy for clarity or to reflect new features. We’ll update the “Last updated” date above.
